Inspirations: 
    Dwarf Fortress, Civilization, Runescape, Megaman 
    Dwarf Fortress 
        Roguelike mode 
        Castle mode 
    Civilization 
        In Castle mode, each civ will have one settlement, similar to DF's Castle mode 
        Settlements will eventually have to expand 
        Civs can send out settlers to found to settlements, expanding their empire 
        Can build trade routes between civs 
    Runescape 
        Each individual character has different skills: 
            Mining 
                lvl1 = Copper 
                lvl5 = Bronze 
                lvl10 = Iron 
            Smithing 
            Farming 
                lvl1 = Potatoes 
                lvl5 = Flax 
            Crafting 
            Fishing 
            Cooking 
            Woodcutting 
                lvl1 = Logs 
                lvl5 = Oak 
            Fletching 
                lvl1 = Arrows 
                lvl5 = Bows 
            Melee 
            Archery 
            Magic 
                Based on runes 
                Requires a medium inscribed with runes / implanted with runic stones to cast 
                Summoning? 
                    Beasts of burden, temporary peasants 
                    Requires a rune stone, which attracts fairies / spirits / valkyries to control the construct 
                Shapeshifting? 
            Defense 
        Character's unlock new crafting items by increasing their levels 
            e.g. Farming level 1 for potatoes, Farming level 5 for wheat, etc. 
    Megaman 
        In Adventure mode, the game world will consist of various 'levels' connected to each other through locked doors 
        Player must defeat bosses to unlock certain doors and progress through the game 
        Defeating bosses unlocks special powers 
        Boss order possibly nonlinear 
            i.e. player can fight bosses in any order, but must defeat all of them before moving on to the final gauntlet ('Sigma stages') 
Tiles-as-objects: 
    Every tile, from the floor to the player to item pickups, is its own object 
    Basic tile attributes include location, sprite, layer, walkability 
    Basic tile methods include draw 
Unity-style layering:  
    'ground' layer, including the floor and walls 
    'actor' layer, including the player and enemies 
    Each tile given a layer, then drawn according to its layer 
        e.g. 'actors' drawn in front of 'ground' 
Game Modes: 
    Campaign and Castle modes will use Runescape-style skills, while Roguelike mode will be more traditionally class-based (e.g. Warrior, Mage, Thief, etc.) 
    Campaign Mode: 
        Story-based, nonrandomized open-world campain 
        Game board is split into different 'levels'; large areas ending with a boss fight 
            Each level is connected to the others, so players can go through levels and fight bosses in a nonlinear way 
    Roguelike Mode: 
        Randomized levels connect to the others through stairs 
        One life; player must restart from the beginning when they die 
    Castle Mode: 
        Dwarf Fortress style strategy game 
        Player controls various units and must build up their city, building workshops, farms, and other buildings 
        Eventual intention to be more like Civilization, where the player creates an empire rather than a singular castle
